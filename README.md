# customer-segmentation
Setup:
1.You will need to have numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

2.The data set is from Kaggle and can be downloaded from this repo.


In this project, tried to figure out who the best customers are.
Following that,following Questions will be answered.
1. Explore the general distribution of the data to get a sense of Male vs. Female customers, and how their income, age, and spending scores are similar or different.
   
2. Explore which gender has a higher income.

Interpretation and Actions:
Based on these data, the following hypotheses could be tested:
1.Marketing cheaper items to women to see if they purchase more frequently or more volume.

2.Marketing more to younger women because their spending score tends to be higher.

3.Thinking up new ways to target advertising, pricing, branding, etc. to the older women (older than early 40s) who have lower spending scores.

4.Figure out a way to gather more data to build a data set that has more features. The more features, the better understanding of what determines Spending Score. Once Spending Score is better understood, we can understand what factors will lead to increasing Spending Score, thus lead to greater profits.
